# Homework 0: Getting up and running

HW0 release date: Wednesday, Sep 4, 2024.

**HW0 due date: Wednesday, Sep 11, 2024, 11:59pm EST**, _but best completed before Wednesday's lecture if possible_.

First of all, **_welcome to the course!_** We are excited to teach you about
communicating with computing especially on technical and real world applications of scientific computing, using the same tools that we work with ourselves.  

We'd like everyone to **submit this zeroth homework assignment**. It will not affect your grade, but it will help us get everything running smoothly when the course starts. If you're stuck or don't have much time, just fill in your name and ID and submit 🙂

Homeworks are in the form of [Pluto notebooks](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl). Your must complete them and submit them on [Canvas](https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/21713) (if you are an MIT student.).

Homework homeworks  (as opposed to presentations) will be released on Wednesday and due on Wednesdays 11:59pm Eastern time.

HW0 is for you to get your system set up correctly and to test our grading software. You must submit it but it will not count towards your grade.

md"## (Optional) Exercise 1 - _Square root by Newton's method_

Computing the square of a number is easy -- you already did it.

But how does one compute the square root of a number?

##### Algorithm:

Given: $x$

Output: $\sqrt{x}$

1. Take a guess `a`
1. Divide `x` by `a`
1. Set a = the average of `x/a` and `a`. (The square root must be between these two numbers. Why?)
1. Repeat until `x/a` is roughly equal to `a`. Return `a` as the square root.

In general, you will never get to the point where `x/a` is _exactly_ equal to `a`. So if our algorithm keeps going until `x/a == a`, then it will get stuck.

So instead, the algorithm takes a parameter `error_margin`, which is used to decide when `x/a` and `a` are close enough to halt.
"

# ╔═╡ 56866718-e6ce-11ea-0804-d108af4e5653
md"### Exercise 1.1

Step 3 in the algorithm sets the new guess to be the average of `x/a` and the old guess `a`.

This is because the square root must be between the numbers `x/a` and `a`. Why?
